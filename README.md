## Mind Gallery

```
User Journey:

HOMEPAGE

As an user,
I would like to see how a Mind Gallery works
And how to implement it with a brainwave device

Initially, I should be able to land on a homepage,
At this point, I see a nav bar
so I can easily navigate on the page

As a user, who wants to start the demo,
I should be able to press ’Start’ 
So I can move forward and start the experience


INSTRUCTIONS

As a user who is new in this field,
I should see on the page some instructions about the brainwave headset
Seeing instructions about how to wear and connect the device

BLINK TESTER:

As a user, who's interested about the  brain function,
I would like to read some information about brainwaves
and blink strength.

Also, 
I should see a brief explanation about brain wave metrics info

```
